 What: fcc/stream_status
 Date: Oct. 2021
    Stream status. This value provides information about lost stream during a channel select.
    The value does not track if a channel is selected or not, it provides only information about
    data losses during a valid channel selected.

    Write:
       * Not available
    Read:
       * comma separated values
        First value:
          0 - No error detected. No channel may be selected, or the channel receiving data continuously
          1 - Channel selected, but we are not receiving data from the Nokia library for some time.
             This may be an indicator of various network issues

        Second value:
         <unsigned integer> - number of times we lost streaming and stopped receiving data during a valid
                              channel selected.
